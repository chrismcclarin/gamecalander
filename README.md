This is a website to track a lot of information about my baord gaming group.

It contains a calender that you can click through to know what game was played when and a list of every game that was played by my group.

The games are listed alphabetically, and can be arranged in several ways including by winners and theme.

New games inserted tell what days boardgaming group met up, what games we had played, the score of each player, the theme of the pick and what factions they were playing at the time. There is also an ability to add comments when creating information.

This uses React and MongoDB.



My plans for the future of the website is to include member logins that would then be able to connect via groupings, so each person could be attached to multiple gaming groups. 
Better Integration with the BGG website that holds a lot of information about board games.
